# API Gateway Implementation

This API Gateway is designed to be scalable, highly available, and secure. It provides functionalities like request/response transformation, caching, rate limiting, routing, load balancing, and enhanced security. Below are the detailed implementation steps and configurations.

---

## Features Overview

### **Deployment and Management**
- Designed for deployment in a real or simulated cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- Scalable, maintainable, and highly available architecture.

### **Authentication and Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles like Admin, Editor, and Viewer.

### **Rate Limiting**
- Limits the number of requests per IP (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes).

### **Routing and Load Balancing**
- Routes requests based on paths or HTTP methods.
- Implements round-robin load balancing for backend servers.

### **Caching**
- Caches responses to improve performance and reduce load.

### **Security**
- Secures HTTP headers using Helmet.
- Enforces HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implements API key management and encryption.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Features in Detail

### **Request/Response Transformation**
- **Request Transformer Middleware**: Handles modifications to incoming request headers and payloads.
- **Response Transformer Middleware**: Adds custom headers and transforms response payloads before sending back to the client.

### **Caching with Redis**
- Implements caching to store and retrieve frequently accessed responses, reducing backend load and improving performance.

### **Security**
1. **Helmet for HTTP Headers**: Ensures secure HTTP headers to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
2. **API Key Middleware**: Validates API keys for access control.
3. **JWT Authentication**: Provides token-based authentication to secure endpoints.

## Scalability and Maintenance
- **Folder Structure**:
```
STAMM/
├── middleware/
│   ├── rateLimit.js - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
│   ├── loadBalancer.js - Distributes incoming traffic across backend servers.
│   ├── requestTransformer.js - Middleware for modifying request data.
│   ├── responseTransformer.js - Middleware for transforming responses.
├── utils/
│   ├── redisCache.js - Utility for caching responses using Redis.
├── routes/
│   ├── admin.js - Contains routes specific to admin functionalities.
├── index.js - Main entry point for the application.
```
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Monitor and rotate API keys regularly.
  - Use distributed caching and load balancers in production.
  - Perform vulnerability scans with tools like OWASP ZAP.

## API Usage Example
### **Routes**
1. **Admin Routes**:
   - `/admin`: Endpoint for admin-specific operations.
2. **Authentication**:
   - `/auth/login`: Endpoint for user login and token generation.
3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - `/api/data`: Endpoint to retrieve data with caching and transformation.

### **Response Headers**
- `x-cache`: Indicates if the response came from the cache (HIT or MISS).
- `x-custom-header`: Custom header added for demonstration.


## Future Enhancements
- Add more role-based permissions.
- Use a dedicated monitoring solution like Prometheus or Datadog.
- Scale the caching layer with Redis clusters.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
